# CrunchTimeCheckmate
The checkmate library for the D2D project

All files are top-level; none of the code written by CrunchTime members is inside a folder.
Filenames are fairly self-explanatory.
"Requirements.txt" is a communication device to help the main team members keep track of who has which libraries installed.

To run the library, you'll need an env with the libraries installed that are in "Requirements.txt".
(The env is, *in theory* included in the repo, but it sometimes doesn't work and has to be deleted & re-created.)
ADVISORY: the most current version of "JessicaRehmel/CrunchTimeD2D" -- the Test Bookstore project -- MUST be installed *and running*
    in order for any of the code in "scraper_tb" to operate; otherwise the program encounters a "maximum retries exceeded" error.
