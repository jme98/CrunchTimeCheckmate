However, the screen size and resolution limitations of any portable device make some of these charts illegible. Due to these limitations, we are providing a link for each chart that you can visit with your computer’s web browser. </p><h3>Hebrew Characters </h3><p>Some ePub readers do not support Hebrew characters. Wherever Hebrew characters are used in the <em>ESV MacArthur Study Bible, ePub Edition</em>, we have inserted them as images. This means that the size of Hebrew characters will not be affected when you vary the text size and may not be the same size as Roman and Greek characters. </p><p>Thank you for downloading the ESV® MacArthur Study Bible </p><p>Sign up for our newsletter to receive information on special offers, new editions, and initiatives relating to the ESV® translation. </p><p><b>Sign Up Here </b></p><p><strong><em>The </em></strong></p><p><strong>MacArthur </strong></p><p><strong><em>Study Bible </em></strong></p><p><strong>ESV® </strong></p><p><strong>English Standard Version® </strong></p><p>John MacArthur </p><p>Author and General Editor </p><p>Crossway </p><p>Wheaton, Illinois </p><p><b>www.esvbible.org </b></p><h2><strong><em>Copyright </em></strong></h2><p>The MacArthur Study Bible, English Standard Version® (ESV®) </p><p>Copyright © 2010 by Crossway </p><p>All rights reserved. </p><p>The Holy Bible, English Standard Version® (ESV®) </p><p>Copyright © 2001&nbsp;by Crossway, </p><p>a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers. </p><p>All rights reserved. </p><p>ESV® Text Edition: 2016 </p><p>Version: esvmsb.v3.no-nav.2016.12.a.epub </p><p>Study helps from <em>The MacArthur Study Bible</em>, copyright © 1997 Thomas Nelson, Inc. </p><p>Permission requests: The ESV text may be quoted (in written, visual, or electronic form) up to and inclusive of one thousand (1,000) verses without express written permission of the publisher, provided that the verses quoted do not amount to a complete book of the Bible nor do the verses quoted account for 50 percent or more of the total text of the work in which they are quoted.

God. These documents are gathered into two testaments, the Old (39) and the New (27). Prophets, priests, kings, and leaders from the nation of Israel wrote the OT books in Hebrew (with two passages in Aramaic). The apostles and their associates wrote the NT books in Greek. </p><p>The OT record starts with the creation of the universe and closes about 400 years before the first coming of Jesus Christ. </p><p>The flow of history through the OT moves along the following lines: </p><p>Creation of the universe </p><p>Fall of man </p><p>Judgment flood over the earth </p><p>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Israel)—fathers of the chosen nation </p><p>The history of Israel </p><p>Exile in Egypt—430 years </p><p>Exodus and wilderness wanderings—40 years </p><p>Conquest of Canaan—7 years </p><p>Era of Judges—350 years </p><p>United Kingdom—Saul, David, Solomon—110 years </p><p>Divided Kingdom—Judah/Israel—350 years </p><p>Exile in Babylon—70 years </p><p>Return and rebuilding the land—140 years </p><p>The details of this history are explained in the 39 books divided into five categories: </p><p>The Law—5 (<b>Genesis—Deuteronomy) </b></p><p>History—12 (<b>Joshua—Esther) </b></p><p>Wisdom—5 (<b>Job—Song of Solomon) </b></p><p>Major Prophets—5 (<b>Isaiah—Daniel) </b></p><p>Minor Prophets—12 (<b>Hosea—Malachi) </b></p><p>After the completion of the OT, there were 400 years of silence, during which God did not speak or inspire any Scripture. That silence was broken by the arrival of John the Baptist announcing that the promised Lord Savior had come. The NT records the rest of the story from the birth of Christ to the culmination of all history and the final eternal state; so the two testaments go from creation to consummation, eternity past to eternity future. </p><p>While the 39 OT books major on the history of Israel and the promise of the coming Savior, the 27 NT books major on the person of Christ and the establishment of the church. The four Gospels give the record of his birth, life, death, resurrection, and ascension. Each of the four writers views the greatest and most important event of history, the coming of the God-man, Jesus Christ, from a different perspective. Matthew looks at him through the perspective of his kingdom; Mark through the perspective of his servanthood; Luke through the perspective of his humanness; and John through the perspective of his deity. </p><p>The book of <b>Acts tells the story of the impact of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Lord Savior—from his ascension, the consequent coming of the Holy Spirit, and the birth of the church, through the early years of gospel preaching by the apostles and their associates. Acts records the establishment of the church in Judea, Samaria, and into the Roman Empire. </b></p><p>The 21&nbsp;epistles were written to churches and individuals to explain the significance of the person and work of Jesus Christ, with its implications for life and witness until he returns. </p><p>The NT closes with Revelation, which starts by picturing the current church age, and culminates with Christ’s return to establish his earthly kingdom, bringing judgment on the ungodly and glory and blessing for believers. Following the millennial reign of the Lord Savior will be the last judgment, leading to the eternal state. All believers of all history enter the ultimate eternal glory prepared for them, and all the ungodly are consigned to hell to be punished forever. </p><p>To understand the Bible, it is essential to grasp the sweep of that history from creation to consummation. It is also crucial to keep in focus the unifying theme of Scripture. The one constant theme unfolding throughout the whole Bible is this: God for his own glory has chosen to create and gather to himself a group of people to be the subjects of his eternal kingdom, to praise, honor, and serve him forever and through whom he will display his wisdom, power, mercy, grace, and glory. To gather his chosen ones, God must redeem them from sin. The Bible reveals God’s plan for this redemption from its inception in eternity past to its completion in eternity future. Covenants, promises, and epochs are all secondary to the one continuous plan of redemption. </p><p>There is one God. The Bible has one Creator. It is one book. It has one plan of grace, recorded from initiation, through execution, to consummation. From predestination to glorification, the Bible is the story of God redeeming his chosen people for the praise of his glory. </p><p>As God’s redemptive purposes and plan unfold in Scripture, five recurring motifs are constantly emphasized: </p><p>the character of God </p><p>the judgment for sin and disobedience </p><p>the blessing for faith and obedience </p><p>the Lord Savior and sacrifice for sin </p><p>the coming kingdom and glory </p><p>Everything revealed on the pages of both the OT and NT is associated with those five categories. Scripture is always teaching or illustrating: 1) the character and attributes of God; 2) the tragedy of sin and disobedience to God’s holy standard; 3) the blessedness of faith and obedience to God’s standard; 4) the need for a Savior by whose righteousness and substitution sinners can be forgiven, declared just, and transformed to obey God’s standard; and 5) the coming glorious end of redemptive history in the Lord Savior’s earthly kingdom and the subsequent eternal reign and glory of God and Christ. It is essential as one studies Scripture to grasp these recurring categories like great hooks on which to hang the passages. While reading through the Bible, one should be able to relate each portion of Scripture to these dominant topics, recognizing that what is introduced in the OT is also made more clear in the NT. </p><p>Looking at these five categories separately gives an overview of the Bible. </p><h3>1. The Revelation of the Character of God </h3><p>Above all else, Scripture is God’s self-revelation. He reveals himself as the sovereign God of the universe who has chosen to make man and to make himself known to man. In that self-revelation is established his standard of absolute holiness. From Adam and Eve through Cain and Abel and to everyone before and after the law of Moses, the standard of righteousness was established and is sustained to the last page of the NT. Violation of it produces judgment, temporal and eternal. </p><p>In the OT, it is recorded that God revealed himself by the following means: </p><p>creation—primarily through man—who was made in his image </p><p>angels </p><p>signs, wonders, and miracles </p><p>visions </p><p>spoken words by prophets and others </p><p>written Scripture (OT) </p><p>In the NT, it is recorded that God revealed himself again by the same means, but more clearly and fully: </p><p>creation—the God-man, Jesus Christ, who was the very image of God </p><p>angels </p><p>signs, wonders, and miracles </p><p>visions </p><p>spoken words by apostles and prophets </p><p>written Scripture (NT) </p><h3>2. The Revelation of Divine Judgment for Sin and Disobedience </h3><p>Scripture repeatedly deals with the matter of man’s sin, which leads to divine judgment. Account after account in Scripture demonstrates the deadly effects in time and eternity of violating God’s standard. There are 1,189 chapters in the Bible. Only four of them don’t involve a fallen world: the first two and the last two—before the fall and after the creation of the new heaven and new earth. The rest is the chronicle of the tragedy of sin. </p><p>In the OT, God showed the disaster of sin—starting with Adam and Eve, to Cain and Abel, the patriarchs, Moses and Israel, the kings, priests, some prophets, and Gentile nations. Throughout the OT is the relentless record of continual devastation produced by sin and disobedience to God’s law. </p><p>In the NT, the tragedy of sin becomes more clear. The preaching and teaching of Jesus and the apostles begin and end with a call to repentance. King Herod, the Jewish leaders, and the nation of Israel—along with Pilate, Rome, and the rest of the world—all reject the Lord Savior, spurn the truth of God, and thus condemn themselves. The chronicle of sin continues unabated to the end of the age and the return of Christ in judgment. In the NT, disobedience is even more flagrant than OT disobedience because it involves the rejection of the Lord Savior Jesus Christ in the brighter light of NT truth. </p><h3>3. The Revelation of Divine Blessing for Faith and Obedience </h3><p>Scripture repeatedly promises wonderful rewards in time and eternity that come to people who trust God and seek to obey him. In the OT, God showed the blessedness of repentance from sin, faith in himself, and obedience to his word—from Abel, through the patriarchs, to the remnant in Israel—and even Gentiles who believed (such as the people of Nineveh). </p><p>God’s standard for man, his will, and his moral law were always made known. To those who faced their inability to keep God’s standard, recognized their sin, confessed their impotence to please God by their own effort and works, and asked him for forgiveness and grace—there came merciful redemption and blessing for time and eternity. </p><p>In the NT, God again showed the full blessedness of redemption from sin for repentant people. There were those who responded to the preaching of repentance by John the Baptist. Others repented at the preaching of Jesus. Still others from Israel obeyed the gospel through the apostles’ preaching. And finally, there were Gentiles all over the Roman Empire who believed the gospel. To all those and to all who will believe through all of history, there is blessing promised in this world and the world to come. </p><h3>4. The Revelation of the Lord Savior and Sacrifice for Sin </h3><p>This is the heart of both the OT, which Jesus said spoke of him in type and prophecy, and the NT, which gives the biblical record of his coming. The promise of blessing is dependent on grace and mercy given to the sinner. Grace means that sin is not held against the sinner. Such forgiveness is dependent on a payment of sin’s penalty to satisfy holy justice. That requires a substitute—one to die in the sinner’s place. God’s chosen substitute—the only one who qualified—was Jesus. Salvation is always by the same gracious means, whether during OT or NT times. When any sinner comes to God, repentant and convinced he has no power to save himself from the deserved judgment of divine wrath, and pleads for mercy, God’s promise of forgiveness is granted. God then declares him righteous because the sacrifice and obedience of Christ is put to his account. In the OT, God justified sinners that same way, in anticipation of Christ’s atoning work. There is, therefore, a continuity of grace and salvation through all of redemptive history. Various covenants, promises, and epochs do not alter that fundamental continuity, nor does the discontinuity between the OT witness nation, Israel, and the NT witness people, the church. A fundamental continuity is centered in the cross, which was no interruption in the plan of God, but is the very thing to which all else points. </p><p>Throughout the OT, the Savior and sacrifice are promised. In <b>Genesis, he is the seed of the woman who will destroy Satan. In Zechariah, he is the pierced one to whom Israel turns and by whom God opens the fountain of forgiveness to all who mourn over their sin. He is the very One symbolized in the sacrificial system of the Mosaic law. He is the suffering substitute spoken of by the prophets. Throughout the OT, he is the Messiah who would die for the transgressions of his people; from beginning to end in the OT, the theme of the Lord Savior as a sacrifice for sin is presented. It is solely because of his perfect sacrifice for sin that God graciously forgives repentant believers. </b></p><p>In the NT, the Lord Savior came and actually provided the promised sacrifice for sin on the cross. Having fulfilled all righteousness by his perfect life, he fulfilled justice by his death. Thus God himself atoned for sin, at a cost too great for the human mind to fathom. Now he graciously supplies on their behalf all the merit necessary for his people to be the objects of his favor. That is what Scripture means when it speaks of salvation by grace. </p><h3>5. The Revelation of the Kingdom and Glory of the Lord Savior </h3><p>This crucial component of Scripture brings the whole story to its God-ordained consummation. Redemptive history is controlled by God, so as to culminate in his eternal glory. Redemptive history will end with the same precision and exactness with which it began. The truths of eschatology are neither vague nor unclear—nor are they unimportant. As in any book, how the story ends is the most crucial and compelling part—so with the Bible. Scripture notes several very specific features of the end planned by God. </p><p>In the OT, there is repeated mention of an earthly kingdom ruled by the Messiah, Lord Savior, who will come to reign. Associated with that kingdom will be the salvation of Israel, the salvation of Gentiles, the renewal of the earth from the effects of the curse, and the bodily resurrection of God’s people who have died. Finally, the OT predicts that there will be the <q>uncreation</q> or dissolution of the universe, and the creation of a new heaven and new earth—which will be the eternal state of the godly—and a final hell for the ungodly. </p><p>In the NT, these features are clarified and expanded. The King was rejected and executed, but he promised to come back in glory, bringing judgment, resurrection, and his kingdom for all who believe. Innumerable Gentiles from every nation will be included among the redeemed. Israel will be saved and grafted back into the root of blessing from which she has been temporarily excised. </p><p>Israel’s promised kingdom will be enjoyed, with the Lord Savior reigning on the throne, in the renewed earth, exercising power over the whole world, having taken back his rightful authority, and receiving due honor and worship. Following that kingdom will come the dissolution of the renewed, but still sin-stained creation, and the subsequent creation of a new heaven and new earth—which will be the eternal state, separate forever from the ungodly in hell. </p><p>Those are the five topics that fill up the Bible. To understand them at the start is to know the answer to the question that continually arises—Why does the Bible tell us this? Everything fits into this glorious pattern. As you read, hang the truth on these five hooks and the Bible will unfold, not as 66 separate documents, or even two separate testaments—but one book, by one divine Author, who wrote it all with one overarching theme. </p><p>My prayer is that the magnificent and overwhelming theme of the redemption of sinners for the glory of God will carry every reader with captivating interest from beginning to end of the story. Christian—this is your story. It is from God for you—about you. It tells what he planned for you, why he made you, what you were, what you have become in Christ, and what he has prepared for you in eternal glory. </p><p><em>John MacArthur </em></p><h2><strong><em>Personal Notes </em></strong></h2><p>Why write a study Bible? The answer to that question comes in a conversation between Philip and an Ethiopian recorded in <b>Acts 8:30–31: </b></p><p><em>So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, </em></p><p><em><q>Do you understand what you are reading?</q> And he said, </em></p><p><em><q>How can I, unless someone guides me?</q> </em></p><p><em>And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. </em></p><p>As Philip did with the eunuch, I want to sit with you and explain the Scriptures. This Study Bible allows me that intimate opportunity. </p><p>Although I personally bear full responsibility for all the notes in The MacArthur Study Bible because they all have come from me and through me, a work of this magnitude with the responsibility to be accurate could only have been done with a team of supportive co-workers who committed themselves to assist me by arduous labor with loving devotion and commitment to excellence. Many friends have participated in the team—all of whom deserve to be commended and thanked. </p><p>My highest gratitude belongs to my friend and ministry partner, Dr. Richard Mayhue, Senior Vice President and Dean of The Master’s Seminary. He has worked next to me through the whole project, laboring beyond anyone while serving as project manager, OT and NT researcher, editor, and counselor. His exceptional gift for management, along with his vast knowledge of Scripture and doctrine, coupled with our one-mindedness theologically, plus his writing skill, have made for a more effective partnership. </p><p>Gratitude in abundance must be given to the faculty of The Master’s Seminary for their assistance in original research and carefully prepared first draft material for the study notes on the Old Testament. Using the foundation of that original research and material, I worked and re-worked the study notes into their final form. </p><p>Never have I been so challenged and blessed at the same time as during the two intense years of finalizing this work. Studying alone in my private place, perusing every word of Scripture, plus being challenged to understand each phrase and verse has yielded richness to my life and ministry like nothing I have undertaken before. </p><p>I have always been committed to the Scriptures as inspired, inerrant, infallible, sufficient and eternal. I have always preached the Bible expositionally, verse by verse, book by book. After this enterprise, I feel even more strongly about the necessity of preaching every pure word of Scripture (<b>Ps. 12:6). I have been profoundly enriched in my own life, as never before, because of the sheer force of so much divine truth pouring through me daily. For many months I spent eight or more hours every day working in the word, not so much because I had to, but because I could not leave the text—its riches held me captive. </b></p><p>My thanks to you, the reader, for loving Scripture enough to be a serious student. This work is an additional way of fulfilling my calling as a pastor-teacher mandated <q>to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ</q> (<b>Eph. 4:12). </b></p><p>A special word of thanks is certainly in order for my beloved wife, Patricia, who supported me with her prayers and encouragement, and endured my times of isolation with understanding. </p><p>With gratitude most of all to our glorious God who gave us his precious word, do I pray that he will be honored by this effort to explain what his word means by what it says. </p><p><em>John MacArthur </em></p><p>How We Got </p><h2><strong><em>The Bible </em></strong></h2><p>Ever since Eve encountered Satan’s barrage of doubt and denial (<b>Gen. 3:1–7), mankind has continued to question God’s word. Unfortunately, Eve had little or no help in sorting through her intellectual obstacles to full faith in God’s self-disclosure (Gen. 2:16–17). </b></p><p>Now the scripture certainly has more than enough content to be interrogated, considering that it’s comprised of 66 books, 1,189 chapters, 31,173&nbsp;verses, and 757,444 words. When you open your english translation to read or study, you might have asked in the past or are currently asking, <q>how can I be sure this is the pure and true word of God?</q> </p><p>A question of this kind is not altogether bad, especially when one seeks to learn with a teachable mind (<b>Acts 17:11). The scripture invites the kinds of queries that a sincere student asks. A whole host of questions can flood the mind, such as: </b></p><p>Where did the Bible come from? </p><p>Whose thinking does it reflect? </p><p>Did any books of the Bible get lost in time past? </p><p>What does the Scripture claim for itself? </p><p>Does it live up to its claims? </p><p>Who wrote the Bible—God or man? </p><p>Has Scripture been protected from human tampering over the centuries? </p><p>How close to the original manuscripts are today’s translations? </p><p>How did the Bible get to our time and in our language? </p><p>Is there more Scripture to come, beyond the current 66 books? </p><p>Who determined, and on what basis, that the Bible would be composed of the traditional list of 66 books? </p><p>If the Scriptures were written over a period of 1,500 years (c. 1405 B.C. to A.D. 95), passed down since then for almost 2,000 years, and translated into several thousand languages, what prevented the Bible from being changed by the carelessness or ill motives of men? </p><p>Does today’s Bible really deserve the title <q>The Word of God</q>? </p><p>Undoubtedly, these questions have bombarded the minds of many. A study of the scriptures alone settles all questions to the extent that there is no need to be bothered by them again. Scripture gives this assurance. </p><h3>Scripture’s Self-Claims </h3><p>Take the Bible and let it speak for itself. Does it claim to be God’s word? Yes! Over 2,000 times in the Old Testament alone, the Bible asserts that God spoke what is written within its pages. From the beginning (<b>Gen. 1:3) to the end (Mal. 4:3) and continually throughout, this is what Scripture claims. </b></p><p>The phrase <q>the word of God</q> occurs over 40 times in the New Testament. It is equated with the Old Testament (<b>Mark 7:13). It is what Jesus preached (Luke 5:1). It was the message the apostles taught (Acts 4:31; 6:2). It was the word the Samaritans received (Acts 8:14) as given by the apostles (Acts 8:25). It was the message the Gentiles received as preached by Peter (Acts 11:1). It was the word Paul preached on his first missionary journey (Acts 13:5, 7, 44, 48–49; 15:35–36). It was the message preached on Paul’s second missionary journey (Acts 16:32; 17:13; 18:11). It was the message Paul preached on his third missionary journey (Acts 19:10). It was the focus of Luke in the book of Acts in that it spread rapidly and widely (Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20). Paul was careful to tell the Corinthians that he spoke the word as it was given from God, that it had not been adulterated, and that it was a manifestation of truth (2&nbsp;Cor. 2:17; 4:2). Paul acknowledged that it was the source of his preaching (Col. 1:25; 1&nbsp;Thess. 2:13). </b></p><p><b>Psalms 19 and 119, plus Prov. 30:5–6, make powerful statements about God’s word which set it apart from any other religious instruction ever known in the history of mankind. These passages make the case for the Bible being called <q>sacred</q> (2&nbsp;Tim. 3:15) and <q>holy</q> (Rom. 1:2). </b></p><p>The Bible claims ultimate spiritual authority in doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness because it represents the inspired word of Almighty God (<b>2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16–17). Scripture asserts its spiritual sufficiency, so much so that it claims exclusivity for its teaching (cf. Isa. 55:11; 2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3–4). </b></p><p>God’s word declares that it is inerrant (<b>Ps. 12:6; 119:140; Prov. 30:5a; John 10:35) and infallible (2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16–17). In other words, it is true and therefore trustworthy. All of these qualities are dependent on the fact that Scripture is God-given (2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16; 2&nbsp;Pet. 1:20–21), which guarantees its quality at the Source and at its original writing. </b></p><p>In Scripture, the person of God and the word of God are everywhere interrelated, so much so that whatever is true about the character of God is true about the nature of God’s word. God is true, impeccable, and reliable; therefore, so is his word. What a person thinks about God’s word, in reality, reflects what a person thinks about God. </p><p>Thus, the Scripture can make these demands on its readers. </p><p>And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, </p><p>which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, </p><p>that he might make you know that man </p><p>does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every </p><p>word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. </p><p><b>Deuteronomy 8:3 </b></p><p>I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; </p><p>I have treasured the words of his mouth </p><p>more than my portion of food. </p><p><b>Job 23:12 </b></p><h3>The Publishing Process </h3><p>The Bible does not expect its reader to speculate on how these divine qualities were transferred from God to his word, but rather anticipates the questions with convincing answers. Every generation of skeptics has assailed the self-claims of the Bible, but its own explanations and answers have been more than equal to the challenge. The Bible has gone through God’s publishing process in being given to and distributed among the human race. Its several features are discussed below. </p><h3>Revelation </h3><p>God took the initiative to disclose or reveal himself to mankind (<b>Heb. 1:1). The vehicles varied; sometimes it was through the created order, at other times through visions/dreams or speaking prophets. However, the most complete and understandable self-disclosures were through the propositions of Scripture (1&nbsp;Cor. 2:6–16). The revealed and written word of God is unique in that it is the only revelation of God that is complete and that so clearly declares man’s sinfulness and God’s provision of the Savior. </b></p><h3>Inspiration </h3><p>The revelation of God was captured in the writings of Scripture by means of <q>inspiration.</q> This has more to do with the process by which God revealed himself than the fact of his self-revelation. <q>All Scripture is breathed out by God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</q> (<b>2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16) makes the claim. Peter explains the process, <q>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit</q> (2&nbsp;Pet. 1:20–21). By this means, the word of God was protected from human error in its original record by the ministry of the Holy Spirit (cf. Deut. 18:18; Matt. 1:22). A section of Zech. 7:12 describes it most clearly, <q>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets.</q> This ministry of the Spirit extended to both the part (the words) and to the whole in the original writings. </b></p><h3>Canonicity </h3><p>We must understand that the Bible is actually one book with one Divine Author, though it was written over a period of 1,500 years through the pens of almost 40 human writers. The Bible began with the creation account of <b>Gen. 1–2, written by Moses about 1405 B.C., and extends to the eternity future account of Rev. 21–22, written by the apostle John about A.D. 95. During this time, God progressively revealed himself and his purposes in the inspired Scriptures. But this raises a significant question: <q>How do we know what supposed sacred writings were to be included in the canon of Scripture and which ones were to be excluded?</q> </b></p><p>Over the centuries, three widely recognized principles were used to validate those writings which came as a result of divine revelation and inspiration. First, the writing had to have a recognized prophet or apostle as its author (or one associated with them, as in the case of <b>Mark, Luke, Hebrews, James, and Jude). Second, the writing could not disagree with or contradict previous Scripture. Third, the writing had to have general consensus by the church as an inspired book. Thus, when various councils met in church history to consider the canon, they did not vote for the canonicity of a book but rather recognized, after the fact, what God had already written. </b></p><p>With regard to the Old Testament, by the time of Christ all of the Old Testament had been written and accepted in the Jewish community. The last book, <b>Malachi, had been completed about 430 B.C. Not only does the Old Testament canon of Christ’s day conform to the Old Testament which has since been used throughout the centuries, but it does not contain the uninspired and spurious Apocrypha, that group of 14 rogue writings which were written after Malachi and attached to the Old Testament about 200–150 B.C. in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament called the Septuagint (LXX), appearing to this very day in some versions of the Bible. However, not one passage from the Apocrypha is cited by any New Testament writer, nor did Jesus affirm any of it as he recognized the Old Testament canon of his era (cf. Luke 24:27, 44). </b></p><p>By Christ’s time, the Old Testament canon had been divided up into two lists of 22&nbsp;or 24 books respectively, each of which contained all the same material as the 39 books of our modern versions. In the 22&nbsp;book canon, <b>Jeremiah and Lamentations were considered as one, as were Judges and Ruth. The following table shows how the 24 book format was divided. </b></p><p><em>The Hebrew Old Testament </em></p><p>The same three key tests of canonicity that applied to the Old Testament also applied to the New Testament. In the case of <b>Mark and Luke/Acts, the authors were considered to be, in effect, the penmen for Peter and Paul respectively. James and Jude were written by Christ’s half brothers. While Hebrews is the only New Testament book whose authorship is unknown for certain, its content is so in line with both the Old Testament and New Testament, that the early church concluded it must have been written by an apostolic associate. The 27 books of the New Testament have been universally accepted since c. A.D. 350–400 as inspired by God. </b></p><h3>Preservation </h3><p>How can one be sure that the revealed and inspired, written word of God, which was recognized as canonical by the early church, has been handed down to this day without any loss of material? Furthermore, since one of the devil’s prime concerns is to undermine the Bible, have the Scriptures survived this destructive onslaught? In the beginning, he denied God’s word to Eve (<b>Gen. 3:4). Satan later attempted to distort the Scripture in his wilderness encounter with Christ (Matt. 4:6–7). Through King Jehoiakim, he even attempted to literally destroy the word (Jer. 36:23). The battle for the Bible rages, but Scripture has and will continue to outlast its enemies. </b></p><p>God anticipated man’s and Satan’s malice towards the Scripture with divine promises to preserve his word. The very continued existence of Scripture is guaranteed in <b>Isa. 40:8, <q>The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever</q> (cf. 1&nbsp;Pet. 1:25). This even means that no inspired Scripture has been lost in the past and still awaits rediscovery. </b></p><p>The actual content of Scripture will be perpetuated, both in heaven (<b>Ps. 119:89) and on earth (Isa. 59:21). Thus the purposes of God, as published in the sacred writings, will never be thwarted, even in the least detail (cf. Matt. 5:18; 24:25; Mark 13:31; Luke 16:17). </b></p><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; </p><p>it shall not return to me empty, </p><p>but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, </p><p>and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it. </p><p><b>Isaiah 55:11 </b></p><h3>Transmission </h3><p>Since the Bible has frequently been translated into multiple languages and distributed throughout the world, how can we be sure that error has not crept in, even if it was unintentional? As Christianity spread, it is certainly true that people desired to have the Bible in their own language which required translations from the original Hebrew and Aramaic languages of the Old Testament and the Greek of the New Testament. Not only did the work of translators provide an opportunity for error, but publication, which was done by hand copying until the printing press arrived c. A.D. 1450, also afforded continual possibilities of error. </p><p>Through the centuries, the practitioners of textual criticism, a precise science, have discovered, preserved, catalogued, evaluated, and published an amazing array of biblical manuscripts from both the Old and New Testaments. In fact, the number of existing biblical manuscripts dramatically outdistances the existing fragments of any other ancient literature. By comparing text with text, the textual critic can confidently determine what the original prophetic/apostolic, inspired writing contained. </p><p>Although existing copies of the main, ancient Hebrew text (Masoretic) date back only to the tenth century A.D., two other important lines of textual evidence bolster the confidence of textual critics that they have reclaimed the originals. First, the tenth century A.D. Hebrew Old Testament can be compared to the Greek translation called the Septuagint or LXX (written c. 200–150 B.C.; the oldest existing manuscripts date to c. A.D. 325). There is amazing consistency between the two, which speaks of the accuracy in copying the Hebrew text for centuries. Second, the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947–1956 (manuscripts that are dated c. 200–100 B.C.) proved to be monumentally important. After comparing the earlier Hebrew texts with the later ones, only a few slight variants were discovered, none of which changed the meaning of any passage. Although the Old Testament had been translated and copied for centuries, the latest version was essentially the same as the earlier ones. </p><p>The New Testament findings are even more decisive because a much larger amount of ma­terial is available for study; there are over 5,000 Greek New Testament manuscripts that range from the whole testament to scraps of papyri which contain as little as part of one verse. A few existing fragments date back to within 25–50 years of the original writing. New Testament textual scholars have generally concluded that 1) 99.99 percent of the original writings have been reclaimed, and 2) of the remaining one hundredth of one percent, there are no variants substantially affecting any Christian doctrine. </p><p>With this wealth of biblical manuscripts in the original languages and with the disciplined activity of textual critics to establish with almost perfect accuracy the content of the autographs, any errors which have been introduced and/or perpetuated by the thousands of translations over the centuries can be identified and corrected by comparing the translation or copy with the reassembled original. By this providential means, God has made good his promise to preserve the Scriptures. We can rest assured that there are translations available today which indeed are worthy of the title, The Word of God. </p><p>The history of a full, English translation Bible essentially began with John Wycliffe (c. A.D. 1330–1384), who made the first English translation of the whole Bible. Later, William Tyndale was associated with the first complete, printed New Testament in English, c. A.D. 1526. Myles Coverdale followed in A.D. 1535, by delivering the first complete Bible printed in English. By A.D. 1611, the King James Version (KJV) had been completed. Since then, hundreds of translations have been made—some better, some worse. Today, the better English translations of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures include: 1) English Standard Version (ESV); 2) New American Standard Bible (NASB); and 3) New King James Version (NKJV). </p><h3>Summing It Up </h3><p>God intended his word to abide forever (preservation). Therefore his written, propositional, self disclosure (revelation) was protected from error in its original writing (inspiration) and collected in 66 books of the Old and New Testaments (canonicity). </p><p>Through the centuries, tens of thousands of copies and thousands of translations have been made (transmission) which did introduce some error. Because there is an abundance of existing ancient Old Testament and New Testament manuscripts, however, the exacting science of textual criticism has been able to reclaim the content of the original writings (revelation and inspiration) to the extreme degree of 99.99 percent, with the remaining one hundredth of one percent having no effect on its content (preservation). </p><p>The sacred book which we read, study, obey, and preach deserves to unreservedly be called The Bible or <q>The Book without peer,</q> since its author is God and it bears the qualities of total truth and complete trustworthiness, as also characterizes its divine source. </p><h3>Is There More To Come? </h3><p>How do we know that God will not amend our current Bible with a 67th inspired book? Or, in other words, <q>Is the canon forever closed?</q> </p><p>Scripture texts warn that no one should delete from or add to Scripture (<b>Deut. 4:2; 12:32; Prov. 30:6). Realizing that additional canonical books actually came after these words of warning, we can only conclude that while no deletions whatsoever were permitted, in fact, authorized, inspired writings were permitted to be added in order to complete the canon protected by those passages. </b></p><p>The most compelling text on the closed canon is the Scripture to which </p></div><div class="end_of_preview"><div class="gradient"></div><span>You've reached the end of this preview. <a href="/archive/pmp_checkout?doc=295105408&amp;metadata=%7B%22context%22%3A%22pmp%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22book_preview%22%2C%22action%22%3A%22start_trial%22%2C%22logged_in%22%3Afalse%2C%22platform%22%3A%22web%22%7D" class="start_trial_btn">Sign up</a> to read more!</span></div></div><div class="cta_wrapper"><a href="/archive/pmp_checkout?doc=295105408&amp;metadata=%7B%22context%22%3A%22pmp%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22book_preview%22%2C%22action%22%3A%22start_trial%22%2C%22logged_in%22%3Afalse%2C%22platform%22%3A%22web%22%7D" class="start_trial_btn free_with_trial_btn flat_btn"><span class="scribd_spinner permanent_rotation" data-size="30"></span><span class="flat_btn_content">Start your free 30 days</span></a></div></div><div class="progress"><span>Page <span id="current_page">1</span> of <span id="page_count">1</span></span></div></section></div></div><div class="all_reviews box"><section class="reviews" aria-labelledby="reviews_heading"><h2 class="visually_hidden" id="reviews_heading">Reviews</h2><div id="all_reviews_module"></div></section></div></div></div></div></div><div id="lightbox_area" class="carousel_scroll_parent"><div id="lightbox_flash_container" class="flash_container"></div><div id="lightboxes_wrap"><div id="lightboxes"><div aria-label="Loading" class="lightbox" id="loading_lb" style="display: none;" aria-hidden="true" role="dialog" tabIndex="-1"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content"><div class="scribd_spinner" data-size="30"><span class="visually_hidden" tabIndex="-1">Loading</span></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="auto__chrome_footer autogen_class_widgets_base global_footer" id="global_footer"><h2 class="visually_hidden">Footer Menu</h2><a href="#global_header" class="back_to_top_link">Back To Top</a><div class="inner"><nav class="columns" aria-label="Quick Links"><div class="column "><h3 class="social_title">About</h3><ul class="list"><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/about">About Scribd</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/press">Press</a></li><li><a href="https://literally.scribd.com/">Our blog</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/careers">Join our team!</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/contact">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/subscribe">Join today</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/referrals?source=footer">Invite Friends</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/giftcards">Gifts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/enterprise">Scribd for Enterprise</a></li></ul></div><div class="column "><h3 class="social_title">Support</h3><ul class="list"><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/faq" rel="nofollow">Help / FAQ</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/accessibility-policy" rel="nofollow">Accessibility</a></li><li><a href="https://support.scribd.com/hc/sections/202246306" rel="nofollow">Purchase help</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/faq?item=adchoices" rel="nofollow">AdChoices</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/publishers" rel="nofollow">Publishers</a></li></ul></div><div class="column legal"><h3 class="social_title">Legal</h3><ul class="list"><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/terms" rel="nofollow">Terms</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/privacy" rel="nofollow">Privacy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.scribd.com/copyright" rel="nofollow">Copyright</a></li></ul></div><h3 class="visually_hidden">Social Media</h3><div class="column social_container"><ul class="list"><li><ul class="auto__chrome__social_buttons autogen_class_widgets_base social_icons" id="autogen_id_981124804"><li class="icontainer"><a class="icon icon-ic_scribd_social_logo scribd" href="https://literally.scribd.com" aria-label="Scribd Blog"></a></li><li class="icontainer"><a class="icon icon-ic_facebook  facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Scribd/6978454082" aria-label="Scribd on Facebook"></a></li><li class="icontainer"><a class="icon icon-ic_twitter twitter" href="https://twitter.com/scribd" aria-label="Scribd on Twitter"></a></li><li class="icontainer"><a class="icon icon-ic_pinterest pinterest" href="https://www.pinterest.com/scribd/" aria-label="Scribd on Pinterest"></a></li></ul></li><li><ul class="mobile_icons"><li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribd-worlds-largest-online/id542557212?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11lGEE" class="app_link"><img src="https://s-f.scribdassets.com/images/footer/apple-badge2x.png?71e5da9e0" alt="Scribd -
